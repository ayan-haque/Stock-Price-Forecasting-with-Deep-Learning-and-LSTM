The Tata Global Stock Price Prediction Project involves training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture on a dataset containing 1200 stock prices of Tata Global Beverages Limited between the years 2013 to 2018. The goal of the project is to predict the current day stock price using the previous 60 days (3 months) of stock prices.

Several popular libraries such as Keras, NumPy, SciKit Learn, and Pandas were used for data preparation, model building, and evaluation. Keras was used to build the RNN LSTM model, while NumPy and Pandas were used for data manipulation and processing. SciKit Learn was used for data preprocessing, including feature scaling and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Finally, the Matplotlib library was used to visualize the accuracy of the model and draw graphs between actual and predicted stock prices. This project is a good example of how machine learning models can be trained to make predictions based on historical data, and how such models can be used to forecast future trends in the stock market.

The image below shows the accuracy of the model:
